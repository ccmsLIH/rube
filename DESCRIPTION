Depends: R (>= 3.0.1), R2WinBUGS, stringr
Suggests: R2jags, coda
Description: This is the original code of the rube package. As there are issues with the
new R version and the loading of the package, a workaround by loading to package 
files to github is tried.
The rube package extends R2WinBUGS or R2jags in many ways.  It extends model
 definition code to allow conditional compilation (IFCASE), run-time expansion of
 model formulas (LC), run time definition of needed prior declarations (FOR), and
 overrideable defaults for, e.g., hyperparameters.  If includes extensive detailed
 syntax error checking and a carefully layed out presentation of the relationships
 between model declarations, data, and intitializations that facilitates detection
 of incorrect and/or inappropriate modeling.  Graphics functions facilitate more
 appropriate specification of prior distributions.  A variety of functions for
 exploring the posterior are also included.  Now includes jags support.
